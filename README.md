# Overview

I wrote a Guess the Number Game in Java. Develop a number guessing game where the computer generates a random number, and the player has to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

The purpose of writing this software was to demonstrate key concepts of the Java programming language such as:

1. Variables

2. Expressions

3. Conditionals

4. Loops

5. Functions

6. Classes

7. Data structure from Java Collection Framework (such as ArrayList, TreeSet, or HashMap)
