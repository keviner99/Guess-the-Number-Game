# Overview

The software I developed is a "Guess the Number" game written in Java. The computer randomly generates a number between 1 and 100, and the player has a limited number of attempts (10 by default) to guess it correctly. After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess was too high or too low. At the end of the game, the result is saved to a file for later review.

The purpose of writing this software was to demonstrate my understanding of basic Java programming concepts such as:

1. Variables

2. Expressions

3. Conditionals

4. Loops

5. Functions

6. Classes

7. Data structure from Java Collection Framework (such as ArrayList, TreeSet, or HashMap)
